PCOS Care is a health-tech app designed to help young women and girls detect and manage PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome) at an early stage. Many times, symptoms like irregular periods, acne, sudden weight gain, and mood swings are ignored, leading to late diagnosis. Our app uses AI + Symptom Tracking to provide awareness, risk analysis, and lifestyle support.
